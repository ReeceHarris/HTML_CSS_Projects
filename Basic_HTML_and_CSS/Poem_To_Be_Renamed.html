<h1>"Fire and Ice" by Robert Frost</h1>
<!-- Poem Body Section -->
<body> Some say the world will end in <span style= "color: red"> fire. </span> <br>
   Some say in <span style="color:rgb(10, 38, 199)" > ice. </span>  <br>
   From what I've tasted of desire <br>
   I hold with those who favor <span style= "color: red"> fire. </span>  <br>
   But if it had to perish twice, <br>
   I think I know enough of hate <br>
   To say that for destruction <span style="color:rgb(10, 38, 199)" > ice. </span> <br>
   Is also great <br>
   And would suffice. <br>
   
<p>Fire and Ice was written in 1920 shortly after WW1 and his work is no longer &copy; written.  </p>
